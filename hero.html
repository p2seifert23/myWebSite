        <p>Bill Gates was born in 1955 in Seattle, Washington. In 1973, Bill Gates attended Harvard University for two years before he dropped out to pursue is business. In 1975, Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen. Today, Microsoft is worth around one trillion dollars and Bill Gate's net worth is over 114 billion dollars. Rather than spend all of his money, Bill Gates has invested billions of dollars in new technology and also started the Gates Foundation in 1994 which focuses on helping solve world problems. Since the start of his foundation, he has donated almost forty billion dollars to it. </p>
        
        <p>I selected Bill Gates as my hero because of all the amazing things he has done. First of all, he started a major technology company when he was only twenty years old with his friend. Also, I think that is really cool how after he made billions of dollars he started a foundation and has helped countless lives around the world.
